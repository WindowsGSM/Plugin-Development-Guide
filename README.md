## Introduction
[WindowsGSM](https://github.com/WindowsGSM/WindowsGSM) (**>= 1.21.0**) starts supporting plugins installation since users want to add their own game servers to WindowsGSM which WindowsGSM doesn't support those game servers yet. More importantly, users can wait for a plugin release on the community instead of WindowsGSM release.

## Basic Knowledge
âœ” Before writing plugins, lets understand how it looks like and how it works. 

#### How plugins works?
WindowsGSM scan the plugins folder and loads **{PLUGIN_NAME}.cs**, **{PLUGIN_NAME}.png** and **author.png** files of each plugin.

##### The plugin file structure is basically like that: (Installed [WindowsGSM.ARMA3](https://github.com/BattlefieldDuck/WindowsGSM.ARMA3) and [WindowsGSM.PaperMC](https://github.com/BattlefieldDuck/WindowsGSM.PaperMC))

##### For **WindowsGSM.PaperMC** plugin, WindowsGSM reads folder **PaperMC.cs** and loads **PaperMC.cs**, **PaperMC.png** and **author.png**

## Set up a plugin development environment
As you know, most game servers use steamcmd to install and update the server. WindowsGSM already created [SteamCMDAgent](https://github.com/WindowsGSM/WindowsGSM/blob/master/WindowsGSM/GameServer/Engine/SteamCMDAgent.cs) class for inheritance purpose, so adding a game server that uses steamcmd is much easier than adding a server that does not support steamcmd. Now let's set up a plugin development environment.

#### Prerequisites
1. [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472)
1. [Visual Studio 2019](https://sr.gdprvalidate.de/redir/clickGate.php?u=8otB939m&m=12&p=3b121G4eNI&t=33&splash=0&s=&url=https%3A%2F%2Fvisualstudio.microsoft.com%2Fzh-hant%2Fdownloads%2F)

#### Preparations
Download or git pull the latest WindowsGSM #master (https://github.com/WindowsGSM/WindowsGSM)

#### Get Started
Open **WindowsGSM.sln** with Visual Studio 2019

##### You should see something like this
