## Introduction
[WindowsGSM](https://github.com/WindowsGSM/WindowsGSM) (**>= 1.21.0**) starts supporting plugins installation since users want to add their own game servers to WindowsGSM which WindowsGSM doesn't support those game servers yet. More importantly, users can wait for a plugin release on the community instead of WindowsGSM release.
